# ProgII SP23 -- Final


GlitchTech LLC has been working on a program for Carly's Catering to handle their catering events. 
Most recently, the developers at GlitchTech created an interactive StaffDinnerEvent class that obtains 
all the data for a dinner event for Carly's Catering, including details about the staff members required to work at the event. 

Staying true to their name GlitchTech's app is full of bugs (glitches) and missing code resuling in their loss of Carly's Catering
app development contract. 

Now, you have been hired by Carly's Catering to take over the devopment project. Following good software development life cycle best
practices, your project manager has sat down with Carly's Catering and completed the plan development phase of the project and has 
identified what needs to be fixed. **Notes have been made in the comments of each class on what, if anything, needs to be done**

You must complete the following:
1. Reach each class carefully.
  
      a. Make sure you understand what the code is trying to accomplish.
  
      b. Make sure you understand your objectives, if any. 

2. Complete your objectives.
  
      a. Fix the class so that it compiles without any errors. 
  
      b. Under the "Documentation" part of each class write a couple sentences describing what the class does. Note that the 
         @param and @return keywords are provided for you as a reference and may not be used in the documentation for every class. 

3. Run the program.
  
      a. When the program runs, you can compare with the sample output below to make sure you get the expected result. Note that the 
         sameple code does not input any invalid data and will not be caught by any exception methods.
